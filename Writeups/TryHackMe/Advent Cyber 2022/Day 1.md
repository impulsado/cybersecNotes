# Security Frameworks
Documented processes that define polices and procedures organizations should follow to establish and manage security controls.

Guide for setting up programs and improve the security posture of the organization.

Frameworks help organizations remove the guesswork of securing their data, because there are processes and structures established.

## NIST Cybersecurity Framework
Developed by National Institute of Standards and Technology. Provides detailed guidance.
Framework focuses on:
`Identify` → `Protect` → `Detect` → `Respond` → `Recover`

## ISO 27000 Series
International Organization of Standardization develops frameworks for different industries and sectors.
(27001 & 27002 → Cybersecurity (Information Security Management Systems))

## MITARE ATT&CK Framework
Tactics Techniques Procedures → Help to identify adversary plans of attack.
MITARE is a knowledge base of TTPs. Highlights the detailed approach when looking at an attack.

# Cyber Kill Chain
Describes the structure of an attack and consists.
Consists of:
- Recon
- Weaponizations
- Delivery
- Exploitation
- Installation
- Command & Control 
- Actions on Objectives.

# Unified Kill Chain
Unification of MITREATT&CK and Cyber Kill Chain frameworks.

Provides a model to defend against cyberattacks from the adversary's perspective. Offers security teams a blueprint for analyzing and comparing threat intelligence.

Describes 18 phases of attack based on Tactics Techniques and Procedures. Can be combined to form overreaching goals.

## CYCLE 1: In
Series of phases for an attacker to gain access to a system or network environment.
- **Reconnaissance**: Performs research on the target using publicly available information (Foot printing).
- **Weaponization**: Setting up the needed infrastructure to host the “Command and Control Center” (C2). Allow the attacker to send commands remotely.
