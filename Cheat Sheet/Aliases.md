# Aliases
These are some examples of personal aliases I've used. They allow me to quickly navigate to certain respositories and quickly open files.

## Adding Aliases
```bash
nano ~/.bashrc
[...]
source ~/.bashrc
```


## Useful Aliases
```bash
# Running VPN
alias htbvpn="sudo openvpn ~/HTB/impulsado.opvn"
```
