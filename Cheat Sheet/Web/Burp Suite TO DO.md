# Burp Suite
security testing application that can be used to perform web requests on web  
applications, mobile apps, and thick clients. Burp offers multiple capabilities such as web crawler, scanner,  proxy, repeater, intruder and many more.

```
A web crawler (also known as a web spider or web robot) is a program or automated script which browses the World Wide Web in a methodical, automated manner. This process is called Web crawling or spidering. Many legitimate sites, in particular search engines, use spidering as a means of providing up-to-date data.  

If you tunnel web traffic through Burp Suite (without intercepting the packets), by default it can passively spider the website, update the site map with all of the contents requested and thus creating a tree of files and directories without sending any further requests.
