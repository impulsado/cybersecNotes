# OSINT
Gathering and analyzing publicly available data for intelligence purposes. Information collected from the internet.

## OSINT Techniques
### Google Dorks
Using Google search engine to search for relevant data, e.j: Employees in a company, passwords…
- `inurl`: Text in the URL.
- `filetype`: Specified file extension.
- `site`: Specified domain.
- `cache`: Latest cached version by Google search engine.

### WHOIS Lookup
Store public domain information, e.j; Domain owner, billing address. Can be used for spear phishing. Now we can use Domain Privacy in some domains.

### Robots.txt
File used to allow or disallow indexing of the website URLs. All websites have one located in the main URL.
They can show admin panels or logs folders.

### Breached Database Search
Leaked data is publicly available. These searches allow the client search if their mail has been leaked.

### Searching GitHub Repos
Developers misconfigured the repository and set privacy option to visible, making public the source code of the program. Sometimes this code includes hard-coded passwords.
