# Key Malware Behaviors
Software created to harm a computer or an entire network. Threat actors develop malware to achieve specific goals, such as infiltrating networks, breaching sensitive data, or disrupting operational services.
Common Behaviors:
-   **Network connections**: Malware tends to establish either external network connections or internal connections. External connections allow remote access or for downloading staged payloads from a threat actors' infrastructure. Meanwhile, internal connections allow for lateral movement, a technique used to extend access to other hosts or applications within the network.
-   **Registry key modifications**: Malware typically uses registry keys to establish persistence, a technique used by threat actors to discreetly maintain long-term access to a system despite disruptions. A good example is Registry Run Keys, which allows binaries to be automatically executed when a user logs in or the machine boots up.
-   **File manipulations**: Malware also tends to download (one of the common reasons to establish network connections) or create new files needed for its successful execution.

# Dangers of Analyzing Malware Samples
```ad-caution
Handling a malware sample is dangerous. Always consider precautions while analysing it.
```

```ad-info
-   Always assume that malware samples will infect your device; hence executing it is not always the first and only step in analysing it.
-   Only run the malware sample in a controlled environment that prevents potential compromise of unwanted assets.
-   It is always recommended to have your **sandbox,** which allows you have a worry-free execution of malware samples.
```

A **sandbox** is a controlled test environment that mimics a legitimate end-user working environment. It gives analysts a safe environment to execute malware samples and learn their behavior. Lastly, having a ready sandbox prevents analysts from running malware samples in their workstations, which is highly dangerous and impractical for the possibility of unwanted impact.

# Static and Dynamic Analysis
**Static Analysis** is a way of analyzing a malware sample without executing the code. This method mainly focuses on profiling the binary with its readable information, such as its properties, program flow and strings. Given the limitation of not executing it, sometimes this method gives insufficient information, which is why we resort to Dynamic Analysis.

**Dynamic Analysis** mainly focuses on understanding the malware by executing it in a safe environment, such as a Sandbox. By doing this, you will see the malware live in action, its exact behavior, and how it infects the environment.

## Profiling Executables through Static Analysis
Since we will start with a Static Analysis, we will use the following tools: `Detect It Easy` and `CAPA`.

### Detect It Easy
This tool provides information about the file, such as its architecture, significant headers, packer used, and strings. More information [link](https://github.com/horsicq/Detect-It-Easy).

1. Open the malware with the software.

2. Now we can see that the malware is packed, so we can't really see the content.

```ad-info
Packing malware is a common technique used by malware developers to compress, obfuscate or encrypt the binary. With this, contents such as significant strings and headers will not be immediately visible to Static Analysis Tools.
```

### CAPA
CAPA detects capabilities in executable files. May it be for the installation of a service, invocation of network connections, registry modifications and such.
