## Guess the Guard's Number
1. Find and talk to the guard, it will say a number that we will take note.
2. Now we will use Cetus to find the memory position that the number is stored. We will choose `i32` (32-bit integer). Cetus also allow you to search for number with decimals (floats) `f64`, `ascii` strings, `uft-8` or `bytes`.
