# Memory Forensics
It is the analysis of the volatile memory that is in use when a computer is powered on. Data on RAM will be deleted when the computer is powered off (e.j. clipboard).

## Why it is useful?
A memory dump is a full capture of what is happening on the Computer at the time. Malware can try to “hide” against the user, but it can't “hide” against the memory.
We can use this capture of memory and analyze what's the malware doing, which who is contacting with, and such forth.

## Introduction to Processes
A process is created when running an instance of notepad. You can have multiple processes for an application.

## Introducing Volatility
Volatility is an open-source memory forensics toolkit written in Python. Volatility allows us to analyse memory dumps taken from Windows, Linux and Mac OS devices and is an extremely popular tool in memory forensics. For example, Volatility allows us to:
-   List all processes that were running on the device at the time of the capture
-   List active and closed network connections
-   Use Yara rules to search for indicators of malware
-   Retrieve hashed passwords, clipboard contents, and contents of the command prompt
