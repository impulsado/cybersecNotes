# Memory Forensics
It is the analysis of the volatile memory that is in use when a computer is powered on. Data on RAM will be deleted when the computer is powered off (e.j. clipboard).

## Why it is useful?
A memory dump is a full capture of what is happening on the Computer at the time. Malware can try to “hide” against the user, but it can't “hide” against the memory.
We can use this capture of memory and analyze what's the malware doing, which who is contacting with, and such forth.

## Introduction to Processes
A process is created when running an instance of notepad. You can have multiple processes for an application.

## Introducing Volatility
Volatility is an open-source memory forensics toolkit written in Python. Volatility allows us to analyze memory dumps taken from Windows, Linux, and macOS devices and is an extremely popular tool in memory forensics. For example, Volatility allows us to:
-   List all processes that were running on the device at the time of the capture
-   List active and closed network connections
-   Use Yara rules to search for indicators of malware
-   Retrieve hashed passwords, clipboard contents, and contents of the command prompt.

| Option | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| -f | This argument is where you provide the name and location of the memory dump that you wish to analyze. | ``python3 vol.py -f /path/to/my/memorydump.vmem`` |
| -v | This argument increases the verbosity of Volatility. This is sometimes useful to understand what Volatility is doing in cases of debugging. | ``python3 vol.py -v`` |
| -p | This argument allows you to override the default location of where plugins are stored. | ``python3 vol.py -p /path/to/my/custom/plugins`` |
| -o | This argument allows you to specify where extracted processes or DLLs are stored. | ``python3 vol.py -o /output/extracted/files/here`` |

### Using Volatility to Analyze an Image
1. First we need to know the operative system of the memory dump.
`python3 vol.py -f workstation.vmem windows.info`

2. Now that we now that is
