# Memory Forensics
It is the analysis of the volatile memory that is in use when a computer is powered on. Data on RAM will be deleted when the computer is powered off (e.j. clipboard).

## Why it is useful?
A memory dump is a full capture of what is happening on the Computer at the time. Malware can try to “hide” against the user, but it can't “hide” against the memory.
