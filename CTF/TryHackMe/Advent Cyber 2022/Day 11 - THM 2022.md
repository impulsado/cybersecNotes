# Memory Forensics
It is the analysis of the volatile memory that is in use when a computer is powered on. Data on RAM will be deleted when the computer is powered off (e.j. clipboard).

## Why it is useful?
A memory dump is a full capture of what is happening on the Computer at the time. Malware can try to “hide” against the user, but it can't “hide” against the memory.
We can use this capture of memory and analyze what's the malware doing, which who is contacting with, and such forth.

## Introduction to Processes
A process is created when running an instance of notepad. You can have multiple processes for an application.

## Introducing Volatility
Volatility is an open-source memory forensics toolkit written in Python. Volatility allows us to analyze memory dumps taken from Windows, Linux, and macOS devices and is an extremely popular tool in memory forensics. For example, Volatility allows us to:
-   List all processes that were running on the device at the time of the capture
-   List active and closed network connections
-   Use Yara rules to search for indicators of malware
-   Retrieve hashed passwords, clipboard contents, and contents of the command prompt.

| Option | Description | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| -f | This argument is where you provide the name and location of the memory dump that you wish to analyze. | ``python3 vol.py -f /path/to/my/memorydump.vmem`` |
| -v | This argument increases the verbosity of Volatility. This is sometimes useful to understand what Volatility is doing in cases of debugging. | ``python3 vol.py -v`` |
| -p | This argument allows you to override the default location of where plugins are stored. | ``python3 vol.py -p /path/to/my/custom/plugins`` |
| -o | This argument allows you to specify where extracted processes or DLLs are stored. | ``python3 vol.py -o /output/extracted/files/here`` |

### Using Volatility to Analyze an Image
1. First we need to know the operative system of the memory dump.
`python3 vol.py -f workstation.vmem windows.info`

2. Now that we know that is a Windows System, we will use the Windows sub-set of plugins.
[All Windows Plugins](https://volatility3.readthedocs.io/en/stable/volatility3.plugins.windows.html)

3. Execute these plugins to know more information:
| Plugin | Description | Objective |
| --- | --- | --- |
| windows.pslist | This plugin lists all the processes that were running at the time of the capture. | To discover what processes were running on the system. |
| windows.psscan | This plugin allows us to analyze a specific process further.	| To discover what a specific process was actually doing. |
| windows.dumpfiles | This plugin allows us to export the process, where we can perform further analysis (i.e. static or dynamic analysis). | To export a specific binary that allows us further to analyze it through static or dynamic analysis. |
| windows.netstat | This plugin lists all network connections at the time of the capture. | To understand what connections were being made. For example, was a process causing the computer to connect to a malicious server? We can use this IP address to implement defensive measures on other devices. For example, if we know an IP address is malicious, and another device is communicating with it, then we know that device is also infected. |
