## Introduction
Blockchain acts as a DB to store information in a specified format and is shared among members of a network with no entity in control.

```ad-info
Blockchain is a digital database or ledger distributed among nodes of a peer-to-peer network. The blockchain is distributed among "peers" or members with no central servers, hence "decentralized." Due to its decentralized nature, each peer is expected to maintain the integrity of the blockchain. If one member of the network attempted to modify a blockchain maliciously, other members would compare it to their blockchain for integrity and determine if the whole network should express that change.
```
