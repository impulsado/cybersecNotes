# SYSTIME
Windows has a default struct made to save information about date and time. 
```c++
typedef struct _SYSTEMTIME {
    WORD wYear;
    WORD wMonth;
    WORD wDayOfWeek;
    WORD wDay;
    WORD wHour;
    WORD wMinute;
    WORD wSecond;
    WORD wMilliseconds;
} SYSTEMTIME, *PSYSTEMTIME;
```
So it makes us easier to get the information for later extract whatever we prefer. 

Along with this struct, Windows also has a function called `GetLocalTime()` that we pass a pointer to a `SYSTIME` struct and the function sets the information to it.
```c++
void GetLocalTime(
  LPSYSTEMTIME lpSystemTime
);
```

# wstring vs string
- `wstring`: Unicode format.
- `string`: ASCII or multibyte format.
[//]: ASCII âŠ† Unicode

Most Windows API need to retrieve wstrings due to Unicode can represent more languages symbols. That's why we must convert the filePath from string to wstring.

# Bitmap
A bitmap is a data structure that represents a digital image as a grid of pixels. Each pixel in the bitmap corresponds to a tiny dot on the screen, and the collection of these dots forms the complete image. The color of each pixel is typically stored as a combination of red, green, and blue (RGB) values.

``` Bitmap
| File Header | DIB Header | Pixel Array |
```
- `File Header`: Store general information about the bitmap image.
- `DIB Header`: Store detailed information (Width, height,...).
- `Pixel Array`: Actual values of the pixels.
