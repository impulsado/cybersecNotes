## tcp_syn_retries
Specifies how many times to try to retransmit the initial SYN packet for an active TCP connection attempt. The current setting is 20, which means that there are 20 retransmission attempts before the connection times out. This can take several minutes, depending on the length of the retransmission attempt.
